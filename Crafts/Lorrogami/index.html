Here is how to make your very own Mask of Lorro origami:
<OL>
<LI>Print <A HREF="folding.gif">this picture</A> and cut it out.
<LI>Fold along line <B>A</B> to make a triangle.  Make sure Lorro's face is
on the outside.
<LI>Flip it over so Lorro's face looks at the table.  Fold on the <B>B</B> lines
so the edges match up in the middle.  Now it looks like a kite.
<LI>Now it is time to make the ears.  Fold on line <B>C</B> so the flap tucks inside.
<LI>Fold towards the center on line <B>D</B>.  You can see her ear sticking up.
<LI>Now, you fold line <B>E</B> up.  Turn it over and you're done!

Lucy says, be sure to color your Lorro!  Can you guess what her favorite color is?
