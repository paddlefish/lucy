<FONT SIZE=5>Lucy LOVES to play games and she's created this riddle just for you!  You have to guess what she likes to eat, but there's a trick!  
<UL>
<LI>The things she likes and the things she doesn't like all follow some sort of a rule. 
<LI> For example, Lucy might like bananas, mustard and lemonade but not grapes, ketchup and coke. 
<LI> The "rule" for this example is that Lucy only likes things that are yellow.  
</UL><BR><HR>Your job is to figure out Lucy's rule for the examples below.  When you figure it out, send Lucy an email to enter her Riddle Contest!
