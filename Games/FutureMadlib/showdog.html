<P><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This
Saturday, Lucy Noun5paw won the Place1 Dog Show &quot;Best in
Breed&quot; award. The judges were especially impressed with her
adjective1 pluralnoun1 that perked whenever she heard the word
&quot;noun1&quot;. She really earned her nickname 'Noun5paw' when
she stomped through a display of pluralnoun2, sending little pieces
of pluralnoun2 flying through the air. Fortunately the judges
didn't see that!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Her
owners were particularly proud. They said, &quot;Lucy would not
be the great dog she is without the great bloodlines of her parents:
Adjective2noun2, and Animal1moor, to which we owe a debt of gratitude.
Truly, great dogs stand up on the pluralnoun3 of their ancestors.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In
honor of her award, Lucy will receive a big bag of pluralnoun4
and a adjective2 blue ribbon. She has graciously decided to donate
the cash award of number1 dollars to her favorite charity, &quot;Dogs
for Pluralnoun5&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lucy
Noun5paw and her owners plan to return home to Place2. When asked
if they would drive all that way, they chuckled and said, &quot;No,
we'll take the noun3. It is fast and adjective4, not like driving!&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Due
to her adjective5 antics and love of verb-ing1 children, Lucy
will appear on TVShow1 next month.</FONT>
