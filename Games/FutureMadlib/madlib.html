<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">One afternoon, Lucy was bored.
&quot;I want to go on an adventure,&quot; she said. So she went
to the magic room1 in her house and stepped inside. &quot;I want
to go number1 years in to the future,&quot; she said, as she pushed
the adjective1 button. Everything got adjective2 and Lucy felt
a little dizzy. Then it stopped and Lucy stepped out of the room1.
&quot;Expression1!&quot; said Lucy. She walked down the street
and looked around. Instead of houses, people lived in pluralnoun1
and drove pluralnoun2 instead of cars. She saw a little girl eating
a noun1 and playing jumprope with a robotic noun4! Lucy wondered
what dogs did for fun in the future, so she peeked in the window
of one of the pluralnoun1. There was a DogBreed1 verb-ing1 on
a noun3 and watching TVShow1 on the tv. When he jingled his tags,
a animal1 came in and brought him a tray of pluralnoun3 to eat.
&quot;Interjection1!&quot; thought Lucy, &quot;This is too weird!&quot;
She walked back to her house and stepped back into the magic room1.
She pressed the adjective1 button and soon everything was back
to normal.</FONT></P>
