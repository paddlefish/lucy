<B>Instructions</B>: Enter your name, then wait for the game to
load. When the scoreboard is shown, click on the dollar value
in the category you want to answer. When the question is shown,
buzz in by pressing return or by clicking the &quot;buzz in&quot;
button. Quickly type your answer, the Jeopardy-style &quot;what

Your name will turn red if you were the first to buzz in.</FONT></CENTER>
